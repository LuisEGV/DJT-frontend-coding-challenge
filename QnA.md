# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

I think that the greatest area of risk for me is implementing the querying of information from the search bar and dynamically make the cards appear while making the main screen fade. I have worked with APIs before, but I think this will be the biggest risk. Another aspect that I am not sure how to implement yet is the sorting of cards. I have done sorting before, but I am still thinking of how I will be able to do this with the API.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

The UI is good, but I might add a different color layout as it might look slightly better, potentially adding a gradient to make everything look better.

The URL in the second mockup (top right) also looks strange due to the color contrast. I will change this to white.

> List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- There should  be a way to scroll over more requests rather than just seeing nine possible cards
.
- In the second mockup, I am not so sure how I am supposed to be able to keep searching more pull requests without reloading the website as the search bar disappears.

- We should also be able to see who is in charge of each Issue (e.g., My Github Icon would appear in the bottom right part of the card)

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
-

> Did you learn anything new?
-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
